# DeathHeatmap

**Visualize your pain!** 💀📊

This mod tracks where you die in a level and generates a **Session Heatmap** to help you identify your choke points.

### Features:
- **Interactive Heatmap:** Adds a button to the Level Info menu.
- **Gradient Visuals:** The bar changes color from **Cyan (Safe)** to **Red (Danger)** based on death intensity.
- **Hover Details:** Hover over the bar to see the exact percentage and death count.
- **Sleek UI:** Minimalist design that fits right into Geometry Dash.

> **Note:** Currently, this mod is **Session-Based**. Data will reset if you restart the game. Persistent saving is coming in the next update!
